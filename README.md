Insurance Claim Camunda BPM and Spring Framework Tutorial.

In the following series of tutorials I am going to show how you to implement an end-to-end solution for an insurance claim process using Camunda BPM and Spring Framework.

# Collaborative modelling with BPMN 2

In this tutorial I will show you how to collaboratively model the insurance vehicle claim process using Camunda modeler.

1. Business Case: Insurance Claims Process. 

     * Allow a customer to submit an insurance claim from a mobile device, and take photos, view claim status and receive email notifications as the claim is processed.
     * Allow a manager to assign a consultant, and approve or decline an insurance claim.
     * Allow a consultant to inspect a damaged vehicle.
     * Select a team.
        
2. Collaborative modelling with BPMN 2 and Camunda Modeler.
    * Development, clone Spring Boot sample project https://github.com/cleophasmashiri/spring-boot-camunda-demo.
    * Model claims process with Camunda Modeler, the 3 amigos session, product owner, tester, developer/analyst.
    * Deployment/Simulation run in cockpit.
    
3. Summary.
     
    * For all stackholders, provides a common visual language. 
    * Works well for iterative development with constant feedback sessions, and simulation runs. 
    * Solves a problem before coding. 
    * Promotes user centered design by envolving all stackholders in the design and development process.
    * Looks at business holistically.
